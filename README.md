# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Here we perform an analysis of company data using PostgreSQL to generate a list of the employees eligible for retirement, a breakdown of the number of
retiring employees by title, and list of the employees eligible for the mentorship program for training to replace retiring managers and other company
members with positions requiring significant experience. We consider the six input data files noted below and summarized in the entity relationship
diagram [EmployeeDB.png](EmployeeDB.png). This leads to the tables shown in [schema.sql](schema.sql) which we then query using
[Employee_Database_challenge.sql](Queries/Employee_Database_challenge.sql) to produce the desired retirement information.
