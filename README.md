# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Here we perform an analysis of company data using PostgreSQL to generate a list of the employees eligible for retirement, a breakdown of the number of
retiring employees by title, and a list of the employees eligible for the mentorship program in order to replace retiring managers and other company
members with positions requiring significant experience. We consider the six input data files listed below and summarized in the entity relationship
diagram [EmployeeDB.png](EmployeeDB.png). This leads to the tables shown in [schema.sql](schema.sql) which we then query using
[Employee_Database_challenge.sql](Queries/Employee_Database_challenge.sql) to produce the desired retirement information.

## Summary

### Retiring Employees By Title
We find from the command `SELECT SUM(count) FROM retiring_titles;` that there are a total of 90,398 positions spanning seven different titles
that will need to be filled due to retiring employees. At a first glance, we see in `mentorship_eligibility` that there are only 1,549
retirement-ready employees also eligible to mentor younger employees, and so we check distribution of the number of mentorship program-eligible
employees by title using the following query:
```
-- Count of employees eligible for mentorship program by title
SELECT COUNT(me.title), me.title
FROM mentorship_eligibility as me
GROUP BY me.title
ORDER BY COUNT(me.title) DESC;
```
This results in the table shown in [mentorship_titles.png](Images/mentorship_titles.png). We thus see there are zero retirement-ready managers that
are also eligible for the mentorship program, indicating a gap in the ability to train the next generation of employees.

### Retiring Employees By Department
We can run similar queries to those which generated the number of employees eligible for retirement and the mentorship program by title to instead
generate tables of these counts by department. We first use the following query to generate a list of all employees eligible for retirement and their
department:
```
-- Employees with departments eligible for retirement
SELECT e.emp_no,
	e.first_name,
	e.last_name,
	de.to_date,
	d.dept_name
INTO retirement_departments
FROM employees as e
INNER JOIN dept_emp as de
ON (e.emp_no = de.emp_no)
INNER JOIN departments as d
ON (de.dept_no = d.dept_no)
WHERE e.birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31'
ORDER BY e.emp_no;
```
We then remove duplicate entries retaining that with the employee's most recent department. From the resulting table, we count the number of retirement
eligible employees in each department as shown in the table [retiring_departments.png](Images/retiring_departments.png). Similarly, we obtain the number of
retirement-ready employees also eligible for the mentorship program as shown in the table
[mentorship_departments_count.png](Images/mentorship_departments_count.png). We thus see that while the company does not have experienced managers eligible
for the mentorship program, the distribution of experienced potential mentors covers each department with potentially opening positions, leading to a more
productive training process.
